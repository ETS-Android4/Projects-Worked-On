# Projects-Worked-On
An overview of projects I have worked on

1. (PHP) - Vak Applications for IoT	
In this project I created a website using PHP which implemented Google API in order to navigate around google maps

2. (Search Algorithms) - S&S practicum 2
Sorting and Searching was a course which is focused on sorting and searching algorithms. In this assignment 
I had to write code which calculates the shortest path to the finish given a tileworld. Working with 
this algorithm is mathematically complex.

3. (Search Algorithms) - S&S practicum 3	
In this assignment the intention was to search for words in a large text
by using the substring search algorithm called KnuthMorrisPratt, I had to implement this myself.

4. (Webapp, JSP) - visio-team
In this project I had to work in a team on implementing a beacon system in a webapp which is supposed to help blind and 
visually impaired people to navigate around a city. JSP was mainily used.

5. (PHP, Arduino, Javascript) - Project 4 IOT Workshop
In this team project I was supposed to give a workshop, we decided to physically create boxes (made from wood triplex)
that used arduino chips connected to LED's in order to demonstrate the basic principles of programming to unexperienced 
students. We used mainly PHP, Arduino and Javascript. We also created a small web application in which users could connect to each 
others' boxes

6. (Android) - Project PAD (bloqs-android)
This was a phone application I made with a team which was used for children's entertainment.
It is an app for android in which the children can solve "block" puzzles and where they create puzzles themselves.

7. (Android) - Project TWM
In this team project I helped and worked on creating an android application which can be used for home security. 
The user would set up a desired amount of phones in the room to be monitored. As soon as motion is detected, pictures and videos
are recorded after which the user is alerted.

8. (Multi-Threading )Dijkstra -Team Thanos
In this course I had to work on implementing multithreading for A shortest path algorithm.
First for running the whole algorithm multiple times parallel and after just a certain part of the algorithm (Node parallelisation). This I did by adding multiple patterns such as producer-consumer and Threadpool.
I also worked with Datastructures such as Concurrent Queue and Executorservice..
